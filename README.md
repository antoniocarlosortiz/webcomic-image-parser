# webcomic-image-parser
Okay so i created an image parser for the online comic Oglaf. The reason for me being so interested in this project is because my internet is quite slow. It is actually so frustrating to read the comic when it takes almost 5 minutes for each page to load.

The script performed successfully and I am pretty satisfied with its results.
